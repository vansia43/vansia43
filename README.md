## Recent Projects
- I wanted to experiment with the `tkinter` Python library, so I created a proof-of-concept affirmations application. I fully believe in the power of affirmations and the Law of Attraction, so this was the perfect way to experiment with a new technology while creating something I could actually use. Check out the [Affirmations Generator](https://github.com/vansia43/affirmations-journal).
- I manage my team's large (150+ tasks per week!) Asana project queue. I created a few useful scripts to automate some manual tasks. Check out my [growing library of Asana automations](https://github.com/vansia43/Helpful-Asana-Scripts).
